# Introduction

The DML (Declarative Machine Learning) language has built-in functions which enable access to both low- and high-level functions
to support all kinds of use cases.

Builtins are either implemented on a compiler level or as DML scripts that are loaded at compile time.

# Built-In Construction Functions

There are some functions which generate an object for us. They create matrices, tensors, lists and other non-primitive
objects.

## `tensor`-Function

The `tensor`-function creates a **tensor** for us.

### Usage
```r
tensor(data, dims, byRow = TRUE)
```

### Arguments
| Name    | Type           | Default  | Description |
| :------ | :------------- | -------- | :---------- |
| data    | Matrix[?], Tensor[?], String, Scalar[?] | required | The data with which the tensor should be filled. See [`data`-Argument](#data-argument).|
| dims    | Matrix[Integer], Tensor[Integer], String, List[Integer] | required | The dimensions of the tensor. See [`dims`-Argument](#dims-argument). |
| byRow   | Boolean        | TRUE     | NOT USED. Will probably be removed or replaced. |

Note that this function is highly **unstable** and will be overworked and might change signature and functionality.

### Returns
| Type           | Description |
| :------------- | :---------- |
| Tensor[Double] | The generated Tensor. Will support more datatypes than `Double`. |

##### `data`-Argument

The `data`-argument can be a `Matrix` of any datatype from which the elements will be taken and placed in the tensor 
until filled. If given as a `Tensor` the same procedure takes place. We iterate through `Matrix` and `Tensor` by starting
with each dimension index at `0` and then incrementing the lowest one, until we made a complete pass over the dimension,
and then increasing the dimension index above. This will be done until the `Tensor` is completely filled.

Currently the datatype of `data`-argument will not change the return value, which will always be a `Tensor[Double]` for now.

A `String` will be interpreted as a vector of `Double` concatenated by spaces and then we apply the same procedure as with
a `Matrix`.

If `data` is a `Scalar`, we fill the whole tensor with the value.

##### `dims`-Argument

The dimension of the tensor can either be given by a vector represented by either by a `Matrix`, `Tensor`, `String` or `List`.
Dimensions given by a `String` will be expected to be concatenated by spaces.

### Example
```r
print("Dimension matrix:");
d = matrix("2 3 4", 1, 3);
dimStr = toString(d, decimal=0)
print(dimStr)

print("Tensor A: Fillvalue=3, dims=" + dimStr);
A = tensor(3, d); # fill with value, dimensions given by matrix
print(toString(A))

print("Tensor B: Reshape A, dims=4 3 2");
B = tensor(A, "4 3 2"); # reshape tensor, dimensions given by string
print(toString(B))

print("Tensor C: Values=1 2 3 4 5 6, dims=2 3");
C = tensor("1 2 3 4 5 6", "2 3"); # values given by string, dimensions given by string
print(toString(C, sparse=TRUE));

print("Tensor D: Values=3 2, dims=1 2");
D = tensor("3 2", list(1, 2)); # values given by string, dimensions given by list
print(toString(D, decimal=0))

print("Tensor E: Values=1 2 3 4 5 6, dims=Tensor D");
E = tensor("1 2 3 4 5 6", D); # values given by string, dimensions given by tensor
print(toString(E))
```

# DML-Bodied Built-In Functions

**DML-bodied built-in functions** are written as DML-Scripts and executed as such when called.

## `lm`-Function

The `lm`-function solves linear regression using either the **direct solve method** or the **conjugate gradient algorithm**
depending on the input size of the matrices (See [`lmDS`-function](#lmds-function) and 
[`lmCG`-function](#lmcg-function) respectively).

### Usage
```r
lm(X, y, icpt = 0, reg = 1e-7, tol = 1e-7, maxi = 0, verbose = TRUE)
```

### Arguments
| Name    | Type           | Default  | Description |
| :------ | :------------- | -------- | :---------- |
| X       | Matrix[Double] | required | Matrix of feature vectors. |
| y       | Matrix[Double] | required | 1-column matrix of response values. |
| icpt    | Integer        | `0`      | Intercept presence, shifting and rescaling the columns of X ([Details](#icpt-argument))|
| reg     | Double         | `1e-7`   | Regularization constant (lambda) for L2-regularization. set to nonzero for highly dependant/sparse/numerous features|
| tol     | Double         | `1e-7`   | Tolerance (epsilon); conjugate gradient procedure terminates early if L2 norm of the beta-residual is less than tolerance * its initial norm|
| maxi    | Integer        | `0`      | Maximum number of conjugate gradient iterations. 0 = no maximum |
| verbose | Boolean        | `TRUE`   | If `TRUE` print messages are activated |

Note that if number of *features* is small enough (`rows of X/y < 2000`), the [`lmDS`-Function'](#lmds-function)
is called internally and parameters `tol` and `maxi` are ignored.

### Returns
| Type           | Description |
| :------------- | :---------- |
| Matrix[Double] | 1-column matrix of weights. |

##### `icpt`-Argument

The *icpt-argument* can be set to 3 modes:
 
  * 0 = no intercept, no shifting, no rescaling
  * 1 = add intercept, but neither shift nor rescale X
  * 2 = add intercept, shift & rescale X columns to mean = 0, variance = 1

### Example
```r
X = rand (rows = 50, cols = 10)
y = X %*% rand(rows=ncol(X), 1)
lm(X = X, y = y)
```

## `lmDS`-Function

The `lmDS`-function solves linear regression by directly solving the *linear system*.

### Usage
```r
lmDS(X, y, icpt = 0, reg = 1e-7, verbose = TRUE)
```

| verbose | Boolean        | `TRUE`   | If `TRUE` print messages are activated |

### Returns

### Example
```r
X = rand (rows = 50, cols = 10)
y = X %*% rand(rows=ncol(X), 1)
lmDS(X = X, y = y)
```

## `lmCG`-Function

The `lmCG`-function solves linear regression using the *conjugate gradient algorithm*.

### Usage
```r
lmCG(X, y, icpt = 0, reg = 1e-7, tol = 1e-7, maxi = 0, verbose = TRUE)
```

### Arguments

| maxi    | Integer        | `0`      | Maximum number of conjugate gradient iterations. 0 = no maximum |
| verbose | Boolean        | `TRUE`   | If `TRUE` print messages are activated |
