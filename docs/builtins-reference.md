# Introduction

Declarative Machine Learning has builtin functions which enable access to both low- and high-level functions
to support all kinds of use cases.

Builtins are either implemented on a compiler level or as DML scripts that are loaded at compile time.

# DML-bodied builtin functions

**DML-bodied builtin functions** are written as DML-Scripts and executed as such when called.

## `lm`-function

The `lm`-function solves linear regression using either the **direct solve method** or the **conjugate gradient algorithm**
depending on the input size of the matrices (See [`lmDS`-function](#lmds-function) and 
[`lmCG`-function](#lmcg-function) respectively).

### Usage
```r
lm(X, y, icpt = 0, reg = 1e-6, tol = 1e-6, maxi = 0, verbose = TRUE)
```

### Arguments
| Name    | Type           | Default  | Description |
| :------ | :------------- | -------- | :---------- |
| X       | Matrix[Double] | required | Matrix of feature vectors. |
| y       | Matrix[Double] | required | 1-column matrix of response values. |
| icpt    | Integer        | `0`      | Intercept presence, shifting and rescaling the columns of X ([Details](#icpt-argument))|
| reg     | Double         | `1e-6`   | Regularization constant (lambda) for L2-regularization. set to nonzero for highly dependant/sparse/numerous features|
| tol     | Double         | `1e-6`   | Tolerance (epsilon); conjugate gradient procedure terminates early if L2 norm of the beta-residual is less than tolerance * its initial norm|
| maxi    | Integer        | `0`      | Maximum number of conjugate gradient iterations. 0 = no maximum |
| verbose | Boolean        | `TRUE`   | If `TRUE` print messages are activated |

Note that if number of *features* is small enough (`rows of X/y < 2000`), the [`lmDS`-function'](#lmds-function)
is called internally and parameters `tol` and `maxi` are ignored.

### Returns
| Type           | Description |
| :------------- | :---------- |
| Matrix[Double] | 1-column matrix of weights. |

##### icpt-Argument

The *icpt-argument* can be set to 3 modes:
 
  * 0 = no intercept, no shifting, no rescaling
  * 1 = add intercept, but neither shift nor rescale X
  * 2 = add intercept, shift & rescale X columns to mean = 0, variance = 1

### Example
```r
X = rand (rows = 50, cols = 10)
y = rand (rows = 50, cols = 1)
lm(X = X, y = y)
```

## `lmDS`-function

The `lmDS`-function solves linear regression by directly solving the *linear system*.

### Usage
```r
lmDS(X, y, icpt = 0, reg = 1e-6, verbose = TRUE)
```

### Arguments
| Name    | Type           | Default  | Description |
| :------ | :------------- | -------- | :---------- |
| X       | Matrix[Double] | required | Matrix of feature vectors. |
| y       | Matrix[Double] | required | 1-column matrix of response values. |
| icpt    | Integer        | `0`      | Intercept presence, shifting and rescaling the columns of X ([Details](#icpt-argument))|
| reg     | Double         | `1e-6`   | Regularization constant (lambda) for L2-regularization. set to nonzero for highly dependant/sparse/numerous features|
| verbose | Boolean        | `TRUE`   | If `TRUE` print messages are activated |

### Returns
| Type           | Description |
| :------------- | :---------- |
| Matrix[Double] | 1-column matrix of weights. |

### Example
```r
X = rand (rows = 50, cols = 10)
y = rand (rows = 50, cols = 1)
lmDS(X = X, y = y)
```

## `lmCG`-function

The `lmCG`-function solves linear regression using the *conjugate gradient algorithm*.

### Usage
```r
lmCG(X, y, icpt = 0, reg = 1e-6, tol = 1e-6, maxi = 0, verbose = TRUE)
```

### Arguments
| Name    | Type           | Default  | Description |
| :------ | :------------- | -------- | :---------- |
| X       | Matrix[Double] | required | Matrix of feature vectors. |
| y       | Matrix[Double] | required | 1-column matrix of response values. |
| icpt    | Integer        | `0`      | Intercept presence, shifting and rescaling the columns of X ([Details](#icpt-argument))|
| reg     | Double         | `1e-6`   | Regularization constant (lambda) for L2-regularization. set to nonzero for highly dependant/sparse/numerous features|
| tol     | Double         | `1e-6`   | Tolerance (epsilon); conjugate gradient procedure terminates early if L2 norm of the beta-residual is less than tolerance * its initial norm|
| maxi    | Integer        | `0`      | Maximum number of conjugate gradient iterations. 0 = no maximum |
| verbose | Boolean        | `TRUE`   | If `TRUE` print messages are activated |

### Returns
| Type           | Description |
| :------------- | :---------- |
| Matrix[Double] | 1-column matrix of weights. |

### Example
```r
X = rand (rows = 50, cols = 10)
y = rand (rows = 50, cols = 1)
lmCG(X = X, y = y, maxi = 10)
```

## `lmpredict`-function

The `lmpredict`-function predicts the class of a feature vector.

### Usage
```r
lmpredict(X, w)
```

### Arguments
| Name    | Type           | Default  | Description |
| :------ | :------------- | -------- | :---------- |
| X       | Matrix[Double] | required | Matrix of feature vector(s). |
| w       | Matrix[Double] | required | 1-column matrix of weights. |

### Returns
| Type           | Description |
| :------------- | :---------- |
| Matrix[Double] | 1-column matrix of classes. |

### Example
```r
X = rand (rows = 50, cols = 10)
y = rand (rows = 50, cols = 1)
w = lm(X = X, y = y)
yp = lmpredict(X, w)
```
