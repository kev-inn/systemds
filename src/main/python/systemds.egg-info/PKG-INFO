Description: 
            
            SystemDS is a versatile system for the end-to-end data science lifecycle from data integration, 
            cleaning, and feature engineering, over efficient, local and distributed ML model training, 
            to deployment and serving. To this end, we aim to provide a stack of declarative languages with
            R-like syntax for 
            (1) the different tasks of the data-science lifecycle, and 
            (2) users with different expertise. 
            These high-level scripts are compiled into hybrid execution plans of local, in-memory CPU and GPU operations, 
            as well as distributed operations on Apache Spark. In contrast to existing systems 
            - that either provide homogeneous tensors or 2D Datasets - and in order to serve the entire
             data science lifecycle, the underlying data model are DataTensors, i.e.,
             tensors (multi-dimensional arrays) whose first dimension may have a heterogeneous and nested schema.
